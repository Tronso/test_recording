# test_recording
A framework to record test cases for autonomous vehicles from simulation data.

This framework was created for my Bachelor's thesis "Recording of Scenarios for Autonomous Vehicles".
Since one component used to execute the framework was developed in an earlier student project I have no rights to publish it.
Therefore the framework is not executable in its current form and the repository solely exists for demonstration and archiving purposes.
